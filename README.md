# DecepTrack - Real-Time Deception Detection System

DecepTrack is an deception detection system developed as a Final Year Project at Monash University Malaysia. It leverages emotional cues through multimodal analysis of video, audio, and text data to provide real-time feedback on the truthfulness of statements.

## Overview

DecepTrack combines computer vision, audio processing, and natural language processing to:
- Analyze facial micro-expressions and emotional states
- Detect vocal stress patterns and anomalies
- Process linguistic patterns and verbal indicators of deception
- Provide real-time confidence scores for deception detection

## Key Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: 
  - Live video and audio stream processing
  - Instant feedback on deception indicators
  - Frame-by-frame facial analysis
  - Continuous voice pattern monitoring

- **Multimodal Processing**: 
  - Video: Facial expression analysis, landmark detection, and emotion classification
  - Audio: Voice pattern analysis, stress detection, and tonal variations
  - Text: Natural language processing of speech transcripts for deceptive patterns

- **User Interface**:
  - Clean, intuitive dashboard design
  - Real-time visualization of detection metrics
  - Historical analysis review
  - Detailed session reports and statistics

- **Security & Privacy**:
  - Secure user authentication
  - Encrypted data storage
  - Configurable privacy settings
  - GDPR-compliant data handling

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the React application:
```bash
cd Web\ \(React\)
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Configure your environment variables
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
